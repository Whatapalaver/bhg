# BHG - (Contract) Bridge Hand Generator

NB. Still a Work In Progress

Inspired by a world in which 4 people are not allowed to gather around a table with a pack of cards.....

This is a Rails app which will generate four hands and allow you to share the game code with friends far afield, so they can assemble their hands from disparate packs of cards.
